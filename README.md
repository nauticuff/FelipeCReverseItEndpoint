Reverse It - Endpoint
CODE: This code prints out the inputted phrase but starting with the last char and ending with the first (The reverse)
Peer review by : Arely Martinez -- Carlos code looks neat and the program works accordingly. 
Might want to add more in the return so the user knows whats going on though like adding the original output aswell. Overall lopoks good. 

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in enterstring/ *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in your phrase.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/enterstring/{phrase}
